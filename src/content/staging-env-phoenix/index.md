When you create a new Phoenix app, it will come with 3 default environments for development, test, and production, where production will be any instance of your deployed app. So we've been trying different solutions with the team to add a staging environment, but eventually, we decided to go for the implementation below. It was suggested by one of my colleagues, thank you [Sjors](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/sjors-baltus-7417473a) üôè

## Redefine MIX_ENV üò±

The first step will be to redefine `MIX_ENV` variable. This step will be different for everyone depending on the deployment infrastructure you are having. You will have to make sure to assign `MIX_ENV` to staging.

### Heroku example

Let's take Heroku as an example.

- By following [this guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/heroku.html) you can find out how to deploy your Phoenix app with Heroku.

- [This guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/multiple-environments) will help you with creating a staging environment.

- Finally, [this guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars) will walk you through the steps you need to take to add environment variables.

I believe, in the end, you will have something similar to:

```bash
heroku config:set MIX_ENV=staging --remote staging
```

The next steps should take place in your Phoenix app.

## Create staging config

Start by creating a `staging.exs` config file and potentially add there all the custom staging configuration you have.

This will be the bare minimum of the file:


```elixir
# config/staging.exs

use Mix.Config

config :my_app, MyApp,
  url: [host: "example.com", port: 80],
  cache_static_manifest: "priv/static/cache_manifest.json"

config :logger, level: :info

import_config "prod.secret.exs"
```

Then, you will need to specify that you want to start your app in a permanent mode for staging env as well; you can do it in `mix.exs` file.

```elixir
# mix.exs

def project do
  [
    # NOTE: the rest of code is skipped
    start_permanent: Mix.env() == :prod or Mix.env() == :staging,
  ]
end
```

### Testing

To test it, you can output the following line anywhere in your views:

```elixir
<%= "Current env is: #{Mix.env()}" %>
```
